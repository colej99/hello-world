# hello-world
First repository

Hello! 
I enjoy making people laugh, late night drives with the windows down, playing and listening to music, and pizza. Don't even get me started on pizza.

I'm currently trying to change majors from ME to Computer Science and figure if it's successful learning GitHub will help me in the future.
